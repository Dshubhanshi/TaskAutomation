# TaskAutomation

This Python script utilizes the Pandas library to read a dataset of student grades from a CSV file. The script then analyzes the grades data to calculate statistics such as the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of grades. The read_dataset function reads the dataset from the specified file path. The analyze_grades function calculates the statistics mentioned above using Pandas DataFrame operations and prints them out. The visualize_grades function visualizes the distribution of grades using a histogram and a box plot, generated with the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. The resulting visualizations are saved as PNG files named grade_distribution.png and grade_boxplot.png. In the main section of the script, the dataset is read, and then the grades are analyzed and visualized sequentially. To use this script, replace "/path/to/your/student/grades/dataset.csv" with the actual file path to your dataset. This script provides a convenient way to analyze and visualize student grades data, which could be useful for educational institutions or data analysis projects.
